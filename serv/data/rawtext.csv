I\'ve written a small doc to describe how to\nget this running in a development setup.\nhttps://github.com/dbcli/pgcli/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst\nPlease feel free to reach out to me if you need help.\nMy email: amjith.r@gmail.com, Twitter: @amjithr\n\nDetailed Installation Instructions:\n\nmacOS:\nThe easiest way to install pgcli is using Homebrew.\n$ brew install pgcli\n\nDone!\nAlternatively, you can install pgcli as a python package using a package\nmanager called called pip. You will need postgres installed on your system\nfor this to work.\nIn depth getting started guide for pip - https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html.\n$ which pip\n\nIf it is installed then you can do:\n$ pip install pgcli\n\nIf that fails due to permission issues, you might need to run the command with\nsudo permissions.\n$ sudo pip install pgcli\n\nIf pip is not installed check if easy_install is available on the system.\n$ which easy_install\n\n$ sudo easy_install pgcli\n\n\nLinux:\nIn depth getting started guide for pip - https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html.\nCheck if pip is already available in your system.\n$ which pip\n\nIf it doesn\'t exist, use your linux package manager to install pip. This\nmight look something like:\n$ sudo apt-get install python-pip   # Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc\n\nor\n\n$ sudo yum install python-pip  # RHEL, Centos, Fedora etc\n\npgcli requires python-dev, libpq-dev and libevent-dev packages. You can\ninstall these via your operating system package manager.\n$ sudo apt-get install python-dev libpq-dev libevent-dev\n\nor\n\n$ sudo yum install python-devel postgresql-devel\n\nThen you can install pgcli:\n$ sudo pip install pgcli\n\n\nDocker\nPgcli can be run from within Docker. This can be useful to try pgcli without\ninstalling it, or any dependencies, system-wide.\nTo build the image:\n$ docker build -t pgcli .\n\nTo create a container from the image:\n$ docker run --rm -ti pgcli pgcli <ARGS>\n\nTo access postgresql databases listening on localhost, make sure to run the\ndocker in "host net mode". E.g. to access a database called "foo" on the\npostgresql server running on localhost:5432 (the standard port):\n$ docker run --rm -ti --net host pgcli pgcli -h localhost foo\n\nTo connect to a locally running instance over a unix socket, bind the socket to\nthe docker container:\n$ docker run --rm -ti -v /var/run/postgres:/var/run/postgres pgcli pgcli foo\n\n\nIPython\nPgcli can be run from within IPython console. When working on a query,\nit may be useful to drop into a pgcli session without leaving the IPython console, iterate on a\nquery, then quit pgcli to find the query results in your IPython workspace.\nAssuming you have IPython installed:\n$ pip install ipython-sql\n\nAfter that, run ipython and load the pgcli.magic extension:\n$ ipython\n\nIn [1]: %load_ext pgcli.magic\n\nConnect to a database and construct a query:\nIn [2]: %pgcli postgres://someone@localhost:5432/world\nConnected: someone@world\nsomeone@localhost:world> select * from city c where countrycode = \'USA\' and population > 1000000;\n+------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+\n| id   | name         | countrycode   | district     | population   |\n|------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------|\n| 3793 | New York     | USA           | New York     | 8008278      |\n| 3794 | Los Angeles  | USA           | California   | 3694820      |\n| 3795 | Chicago      | USA           | Illinois     | 2896016      |\n| 3796 | Houston      | USA           | Texas        | 1953631      |\n| 3797 | Philadelphia | USA           | Pennsylvania | 1517550      |\n| 3798 | Phoenix      | USA           | Arizona      | 1321045      |\n| 3799 | San Diego    | USA           | California   | 1223400      |\n| 3800 | Dallas       | USA           | Texas        | 1188580      |\n| 3801 | San Antonio  | USA           | Texas        | 1144646      |\n+------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+\nSELECT 9\nTime: 0.003s\n\nExit out of pgcli session with Ctrl + D and find the query results:\nsomeone@localhost:world>\nGoodbye!\n9 rows affected.\nOut[2]:\n[(3793, u\'New York\', u\'USA\', u\'New York\', 8008278),\n (3794, u\'Los Angeles\', u\'USA\', u\'California\', 3694820),\n (3795, u\'Chicago\', u\'USA\', u\'Illinois\', 2896016),\n (3796, u\'Houston\', u\'USA\', u\'Texas\', 1953631),\n (3797, u\'Philadelphia\', u\'USA\', u\'Pennsylvania\', 1517550),\n (3798, u\'Phoenix\', u\'USA\', u\'Arizona\', 1321045),\n (3799, u\'San Diego\', u\'USA\', u\'California\', 1223400),\n (3800, u\'Dallas\', u\'USA\', u\'Texas\', 1188580),\n (3801, u\'San Antonio\', u\'USA\', u\'Texas\', 1144646)]\n\nThe results are available in special local variable _, and can be assigned to a variable of your\nchoice:\nIn [3]: my_result = _\n\nPgcli only runs on Python3.7+ since 4.0.0, if you use an old version of Python,\nyou should use install pgcli <= 4.0.0.\n\nThanks:\nA special thanks to Jonathan Slenders for\ncreating Python Prompt Toolkit,\nwhich is quite literally the backbone library, that made this app possible.\nJonathan has also provided valuable feedback and support during the development\nof this app.\nClick is used for command line option parsing\nand printing error messages.\nThanks to psycopg for providing a rock solid\ninterface to Postgres database.\nThanks to all the beta testers and contributors for your time and patience. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n      Postgres CLI with autocompletion and syntax highlighting\n    \n\n\n\n\n\npgcli.com\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n  python\n\n\n  postgres\n\n\n  database\n\n\n  postgresql\n\n\n  psql\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n      Readme\n \nLicense\n\n\n\n\n\n     BSD-3-Clause license\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\nStars\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2k\n    stars\n\nWatchers\n\n\n\n\n\n133\n    watching\n\nForks\n\n\n\n\n\n519\n    forks\n\n\n\n        Report repository\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Releases\n\n\n\n\n\n87\ntags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Packages\n      0\n\n\n        No packages published \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Used by 1k\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            + 1,028\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Contributors\n      145\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      + 134 contributors\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython\n98.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGherkin\n1.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n0.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        © 2023 GitHub, Inc.\n        \n\n\n\nFooter navigation\n\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact GitHub\nPricing\nAPI\nTraining\nBlog\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    You can’t perform that action at this time.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

Not any more.One of the most commonly repeated maxims in science is that correlation is not causation. And there is no shortage of examples demonstrating why. One of the most famous is the case of hormone replacement therapy, which was studied by numerous epidemiologists at the end of the last century.These studies showed that women who took hormone replacement therapy had less chance of developing heart disease. Naturally, doctors suggested that hormone replacement therapy somehow protected against heart disease.That turned out to be an erroneous conclusion. Later studies showed that women who took hormone replacement therapy were likely to be from higher socio-economic groups with higher incomes, better diets and generally healthier outcomes. It was this that caused the correlation the earlier studies had found. By contrast, proper randomised controlled trials showed that hormone replacement therapy actually increased the risk of heart disease.In the absence of controlled trials, statisticians have widely assumed that it is impossible to determine cause and effect from an observed correlation alone. Does Y cause X or X cause Y? The apparent symmetry of this scenario seems to exclude the possibility that any statistical test could tease them apart.But in the last few years, statisticians have begun to explore a number of ways to solve this problem. They say that in certain circumstances it is indeed possible to determine cause and effect based only on the observational data.At first sight, that sounds like a dangerous statement. But today Joris Mooij at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and a few pals, show just how effective this new approach can be by applying it to a wide range of real and synthetic datasets. Their remarkable conclusion is that it is indeed possible to separate cause and effect in this way.Mooij and co confine themselves to the simple case of data associated with two variables, X and Y. A real-life example might be a set of data of measured wind speed, X, and another set showing the rotational speed of a wind turbine, Y.These datasets are clearly correlated. But which is the cause and which the effect? Without access to a controlled experiment, it is easy to imagine that it is impossible to tell.The basis of the new approach is to assume that the relationship between X and Y is not symmetrical. In particular, they say that in any set of measurements there will always be noise from various cause. The key assumption is that the pattern of noise in the cause will be different to the pattern of noise in the effect. That’s because any noise in X can have an influence on Y but not vice versa.So the datasets should reflect this. The task for a statistician is to develop a statistical test that can tell the difference.Just such a test exists and known as the additional noise model. This assumes that each dataset is made up of the relevant data as well as various sources of noise. Statisticians have shown that the nonlinearity of this process can allow them to determine the direction of cause-and-effect.Now Mooij and co have tested how well this works on a wide variety of different datasets that they have compiled for just this purpose. Each dataset consists of samples of a pair of statistically dependent random variables where one variable is known to cause the other. The challenge is to identify which of the variables is the cause and which the effect.In total, Mooij and co have collected 88 datasets of cause-and-effect pairs from more than 30 different areas of science. For example, they have measurements of altitude and mean annual temperature for more than 300 weather stations in Germany. Mooij and co say it is obvious that altitude causes temperature rather than the other way round but determining this from the data is far from straightforward.Another dataset relates to the daily snowfall at Whistler in Canada and contains measurements of temperature and the total amount of snow. Obviously temperature is one of the causes of the total amount of snow rather than the other way round.Another dataset relates to the cost of rooms and apartments for students and consists of the size of the apartment and the monthly rent. Again it is obvious that the size causes the rent and not vice versa. In total there are 88 different datasets along with the ground truth knowledge of which variable is the cause in which the effect.Mooij and co then use the additive noise model to work out which of the variables in each case is the cause and which is the effect.The results make for interesting reading. They say the additive noise model is up to 80 per cent accurate in correctly determining cause-and-effect. And they say that the method is robust against small perturbations of the data that can arise from the way it is handled statistically. “Our empirical results provide evidence that additive-noise methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data,” they conclude.That’s a fascinating outcome. It means that statisticians have good reason to question the received wisdom that it is impossible to determine cause and effect from observational data alone.It’s worth pointing out that this applies only in the very simple situation in which one variable causes the other. But of course there are plenty of much more complex scenarios where this method will not be so fruitful.Nevertheless, this is likely to be a powerful new addition to a statistician’s armoury. There are many situations in science where controlled experiments are simply not possible because they are too expensive, unethical or technically impossible. In those situations, the additive noise model could be a game-changer.Ref: arxiv.org/abs/1412.3773 : Distinguishing Cause From Effect Using Observational Data: Methods And BenchmarksFollow the Physics arXiv Blog on Twitter at @arxivblog and on Facebook----5FollowWritten by The Physics arXiv Blog10.6K Followers·Editor for The Physics arXiv BlogAn alternative view of the best new ideas in science.
